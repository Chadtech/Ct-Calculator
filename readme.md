# HI THERE

This is my 

# React Gulp Browserify Boilerplate

Its basically a template of a React app how I would like to make it, with the dependencies I would like to use. Maybe it has the dependencies you would like to use too.

How to get going..
```
> git clone https://github.com/Chadtech/react-gulp-browserify-boilerplate new-project
> cd new-project
> npm install
> gulp

then open up http://localhost:2980
```
